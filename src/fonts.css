/* Fonts abstraction layer */
/* Fallback to system fonts since we cannot reach Google Fonts or npm */

/* 
 * We are relying on the Tailwind config's font stack which already includes system fonts.
 * By not importing anything here, we just use the next available font in the list.
 * 
 * tailsind.config.ts has: 
 * 'Plus Jakarta Sans', '-apple-system', 'BlinkMacSystemFont', 'Segoe UI', ...
 * 
 * Since 'Plus Jakarta Sans' isn't loaded, browser will use 'Segoe UI' (Windows) or others.
 * This satisfies the "offline" requirement.
